Project Title
IoT Based Intelligent Walking System for Visually Impaired

Overview
This project is aimed at developing an innovative solution to assist visually impaired individuals in navigating their surroundings safely.
By utilizing IoT (Internet of Things) technologies, this intelligent walking system enhances mobility and independence for visually impaired individuals. This README file 
provides a comprehensive overview of the project, highlighting its objectives and key features.

Project Description
The IoT Based Intelligent Walking System for Visually Impaired is a cutting-edge solution that incorporates sensors, communication devices, and smart algorithms to aid visually
impaired individuals in detecting obstacles and navigating their environment confidently. The system utilizes real-time data processing and feedback mechanisms to provide users
with auditory and tactile cues, ensuring safe and efficient mobility.

Key Features
Object Detection: The system utilizes sensors and computer vision algorithms to detect obstacles in the user's path, providing real-time alerts.
Navigation Assistance: Through a combination of audio instructions and tactile feedback, the system guides users along predefined routes or towards specified destinations.
Remote Monitoring: The system allows designated individuals, such as caregivers or family members, to remotely monitor the user's location and receive alerts in case of 
emergencies.

Customizability: The system can be tailored to individual users' needs, including preferred navigation styles, voice prompts, and sensitivity settings.

Technologies Used:
ESP32 Microcontroller
Ultrasonic sensors
ARDUINO IDE
C++ Programming
